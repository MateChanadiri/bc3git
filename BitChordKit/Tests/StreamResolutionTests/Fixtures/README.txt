Test fixtures for StreamResolutionTests. Load with StreamFixture (StreamTestSupport.swift), which
wraps Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Fixtures/<name>", withExtension: nil).

All recorded 2026-09-26 from the live services, signed out. The machine's public IP, which
googlevideo embeds in every stream URL (ip=...), and which sw.js_data and the shell echo, was
replaced with the documentation address 2001:db8::1 in every form it appeared (raw, %-encoded,
double-%-encoded). Nothing else was edited.
