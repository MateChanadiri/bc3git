Edits made to recorded responses (none change what the parser reads):
  - tracking-only keys removed: trackingParams, clickTrackingParams, loggingContext, frameworkUpdates,
    serviceTrackingParams, mainAppWebResponseContext, loggingDirectives, accessibility, accessibilityData;
  - long lists capped to their first N items to keep the fixtures small (home 10, explore/new releases
    8, mood 6, artist carousels 8, next queue 15, playlist rows 20-25); continuation items are kept;
  - lyrics.json keeps only the first two lines of the song's lyrics (copyright);
  - the capture machine's IP address (remoteHost) replaced with 2001:db8::1.

signed_in/ holds signed-in responses, which can't be captured without a Google account. They are built
from the Android parser's expectations and the Kotlin unit tests, wrapping real signed-out renderers
where possible: account menu, accounts_list / account switcher (the AccountChannelTest items), history,
Liked Music (+continuation), library feeds, a signed-in next with like buttons and library toggles, the
signed-in shell's ytcfg keys, a signed-in Home continuation, edit/create/like responses, a transcript and
a player response with playbackTracking.
