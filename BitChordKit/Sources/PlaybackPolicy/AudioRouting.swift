/// ### What changes on iOS
///
/// Android lists every connected sink and lets the listener pick one, because its player can be
/// pointed at any of them (`setPreferredAudioDevice`). iOS gives an app neither half: the only
/// outputs it can see are the ones in the *current* route (`AVAudioSession.currentRoute.outputs`),
/// and choosing another is the system's job — the picker is `AVRoutePickerView` (PORTING.md §4). So
/// the selection state (`selectedId`/`select`/`forget`) is not ported, and every device described
/// here is active. What survives is the description: kinds worth telling apart on screen, a name
/// that is not the phone's model number, one row per physical device.
///
/// Android's reason for reading the device list rather than MediaRouter — the router's answer
/// flickered while a Bluetooth profile connected — has an iOS counterpart: re-read on
/// `AVAudioSession.routeChangeNotification` (``routeChanges()``) rather than caching a route.
