/// The second look: a track that started on less than was asked for gets the question asked again,

///
/// The live path has to answer in the time a listener will wait for a track to start, and it buys
/// that by giving up on the slow catalogue — regularly the one holding the lossless copy. Measured
/// on Android: the fastest module answered a search in 1.3 s, the slowest in 5.4 s plus a further

/// with sound already coming out.

/// So: play whatever can be had now, then look again with no time limit, and swap only if the answer
/// is genuinely the same recording *and* genuinely better than what is playing — usually the lossless

///
/// ### How the swap reaches the player
///
/// The queue holds `bitchord://watch?v=…` URIs that the player's resolver turns into real URLs at
/// open time (``PlaybackURI``). An upgrade re-points that indirection rather than touching the
/// queue: the stream is parked (``force(_:stream:)``), the item is replaced with the same URI plus a
/// `q=` marker (``upgradedURI(_:)``), and the marker does two jobs — it makes the item unequal to its
/// old self so the player actually rebuilds it, and it keys the disk cache separately
/// (``cacheTag(_:)``) so the FLAC is not written into the middle of the half-cached copy it replaces.
///
/// ### Lifetime
///
/// Everything here is scoped to the player. When the Playback engine is torn down and rebuilt within
/// one app process, call ``forgetLastSession()`` (and ``NerdStats/forgetLastSession()``) so a warm
/// restart behaves like a cold one.
///
/// Thread-safe; ``lookAgain(_:playingDurationSec:)`` is the only async entry point.
