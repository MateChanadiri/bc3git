// Ports playback/StreamChoice.kt.

/// Which copy of a track is being served, remembered for as long as the track is being served from
/// it.
///
/// A player opens a source many times over one play: the initial read, a seek past the buffer, a
/// resume, and — the one that matters — the continuation fetch when playback reaches the end of
/// what the cache holds. Every one of those goes back through the resolver, and each was free to
/// come back with a *different* answer. Measured on Android: a track started on YouTube with 57
/// seconds pre-buffered, and its continuation fetch resolved to a module's 320 kbps AAC instead.
/// The player was handed the middle of an MP4 where it expected the rest of a WebM and failed with
/// `EOFException`.
///
/// Two sources cannot share one cache entry, and the cache's key cannot tell them apart: it is
/// computed before the resolve, off the `bitchord://watch?v=…` URI, when which server will answer is
/// not yet known. So the entry does not learn who is filling it; the resolver is held to whoever
/// filled it first. ``QualityUpgrade`` works the same way for the streams it swaps in.
///
/// ### Why a time limit
///
/// A module's stream URL is signed and expires (around five hours on the catalogues in use). Holding
/// one indefinitely would eventually hand the player a dead URL rather than a wrong one, which is no
/// better. ``ttl`` is far inside every expiry seen, so a choice is either reused while it is certainly
/// still good or made again from scratch.
///
/// Thread-safe: the resolver, the read-ahead and the recovery path all call in from their own
/// threads.
