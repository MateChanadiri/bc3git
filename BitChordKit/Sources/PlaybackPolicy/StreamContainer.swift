/// Whether the URL serving a track points at audio or at an index of it.
///
/// A source's stream URL is whatever its backend feels like serving, and that is not always a file.
/// Tidal answers a lossless or Dolby Atmos request with an MPEG-DASH manifest, and answered the same
/// request with an HLS one until September 2026 — same track, same tier. The playback URIs this app
/// queues (`bitchord://watch?v=…`, `bitchord://source?…`) carry no extension to infer from, so the
/// player defaults to treating the bytes as a progressive file, and a progressive reader handed a
/// manifest fails with the only error it can raise ("none of the extractors could read the stream").
///
/// That URL was not broken, which is the whole reason this exists: sixteen seconds later the
/// identical URL played as Dolby Atmos because it arrived through the one path that declared the
/// type. The failure had been read as a dead stream and the track struck off substitution for the
/// session.
///
/// So "what is on the end of this URL" gets one answer, asked where an upgrade builds its item, where
/// the live path decides whether it may substitute at all, and where a failed track is put back on
/// its feet. Judged on the extension (or on what a source *declared*), never on the codec a module
/// named: `format: "flac"` describes the audio inside and says nothing about the envelope.
///
/// ### On iOS

/// `AVPlayer` plays HLS natively and cannot play DASH at all (PORTING.md §4). The Playback module
/// uses ``transport(of:)`` to hand an HLS URL to `AVURLAsset` with `AVURLAssetOverrideMIMETypeKey`
/// when the URL has no `.m3u8` to sniff, and to treat a DASH answer as unplayable — falling back to
/// YouTube (``PlaybackFallback``) — rather than as a broken stream.
