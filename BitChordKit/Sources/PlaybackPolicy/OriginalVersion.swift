/// "Revert to original" used to be a fact about one queue entry: the item was replaced with a
/// direct-YouTube one and that was the end of it. Play the same song again tomorrow, or come back
/// round to it in the queue, and the substitution and upgrade machinery started over and put the
/// listener right back on the copy they had just rejected. A revert is the listener saying this
/// catalogue match is wrong for this song, and the only useful lifetime for that is "until they say
/// otherwise".
///
/// So it is written down (`UserDefaults`), and ``PlaybackURI/forStreaming(_:pinnedToOriginal:)``
/// reads it wherever a queue entry is built — from a list, from CarPlay, from the restored queue — so
/// a pinned track is built as the direct-YouTube item it was reverted to. That covers a relaunch,
/// which an in-memory set would miss.
///
/// "Upgrade quality" in the player's menu is the way back out (``QualityUpgrade/requestByHand(_:nowMs:upgradeRunning:originalVersion:)``).

/// listener asked for.
