/// say *which rendition* of a track it wants without knowing any URL: the upgraded copy
/// (`q=hifi`, `q=hifi-2`), YouTube's own upload after a revert (`direct_youtube=1&q=original`), or a
/// manifest re-open (`manifest_reopen=dash`). On iOS the Playback module's `AVAssetResourceLoader`
/// plays the part of the resolving data source, and the AudioCache keys renditions apart off the
/// same marker (see ``QualityUpgrade/cacheTag(_:)``).
///
/// Everything here is string work, deliberately: the rules must survive round trips through the
/// queue snapshot and a party sync byte for byte, and the Android tests that pin them down are
/// written against literal strings.
