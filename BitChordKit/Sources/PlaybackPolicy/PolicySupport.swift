/// Android's `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`, which every expiry here was measured against. The
/// distinction matters for exactly the thing those expiries protect: a signed stream URL dies on
/// wall-clock time, so a clock that pauses during sleep (`ProcessInfo.systemUptime`) would let a
/// phone left in a pocket overnight wake up still trusting a URL that expired hours ago. Darwin's
