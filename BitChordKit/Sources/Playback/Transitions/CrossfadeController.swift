/// A real crossfade: two tracks audible at once, the outgoing one falling as the incoming one rises

///
/// ## Two decks, and which plays what
///
/// One player renders one item at a time, so at a track boundary the only gains available are 1 (no
/// fade) or 0 (silence). Overlap needs a second decoder. The two decks are peers: at any instant one
/// *is* the session and the other is idle, and they swap roles at every transition. To arm a
/// transition the standby is loaded with the **incoming** track, cued and silent. Loading the
/// incoming (never the outgoing) track on the standby means the two players never hold the same
/// audio, so there is nothing to align and no instant of audio rendered twice.
///
/// ## The handoff
///
/// Finishing the swap is a role change, not a seek: nothing is re-buffered. It happens as the
/// incoming track's first note sounds, not at the end of the blend, so the queue, the metadata and
/// the lock screen flip to the incoming song the moment it becomes audible. From then on the
/// outgoing deck is the idle one, still audible, being faded out.
///
/// ## Rules
///
/// - Crossfade is a property of tracks *running out*. A skip or a seek drops any blend in flight:
///   the point of pressing next is to stop hearing the current track.
/// - A pause parks the fade where it stands, because progress is read off the incoming track's
///   position rather than a clock, and the other deck follows the session's play/pause every tick.
/// - The fade is capped at a third of either track, so a long crossfade into a short track tightens
///   rather than swallowing it.
/// - Repeat-one never crossfades a track into itself; a Listen Together party never crossfades
///   (every member would start the next song at a different moment).
/// - With "sleep after this track" armed there is no next track: the outgoing one fades to silence
///   over the same span and pauses.
