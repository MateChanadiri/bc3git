/// The on-disk half of the audio cache: one sparse file per entry plus a JSON range index, the
/// eviction bookkeeping, and the fetches that fill the holes.
///
/// ## Layout
///
/// `<directory>/<hash>.audio` holds an entry's bytes at their real offsets (a sparse file: holes
/// cost nothing), `<hash>.json` its key, length, type and the spans on disk. The index is rewritten
/// after the bytes it describes are written (with a barrier fsync between), so a crash can lose the
/// last span but never describe bytes that aren't there. Opening reconciles the two: spans past the
/// end of their file are dropped, and entries whose file vanished (lost when the cache lived in
/// `Caches`, which iOS purges) are forgotten, as Media3's cache dropped spans whose files disappeared.
///
/// ## Fetches
///
/// A hole is filled by exactly one fetch at a time. Everyone who needs bytes from it — the player,
/// read-ahead, the analysis head — subscribes to that fetch and is handed each piece as it arrives,
/// so a range is never downloaded twice and nobody waits for a whole range to land before playing
/// its first bytes. This replaces Media3's one-writer-per-entry lock, whose contention the Android
/// comments spend pages on: a read-ahead that lost the lock to the player downloaded nine megabytes
/// into nowhere. Here the loser simply joins.
///
/// A fetch keeps going after its last subscriber finished normally, to the next whole
/// ``lingerBytes`` from where it started (so the player's two-byte probe turns into a useful first
/// range, and a fetch never stops partway through one of the source's own bounded requests), and
/// stops as soon as its last subscriber is cancelled (a skip or a seek).
///
/// The opening of an entry is held back until its MP4 init segment is complete, so the duration
/// fix in ``FragmentedMP4Durations`` is written to disk with it. Bytes are written to disk as they arrive; a
/// write that fails (full disk) turns the rest of that fetch into a pass-through rather than a
/// playback error, as `FLAG_IGNORE_CACHE_ON_ERROR` did on Android.
