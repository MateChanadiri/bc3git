/// with holes filled from the source as they're reached (and written to disk on the way through).
/// Content information (type, length, byte-range support) comes from the entry's index when the
/// track has been opened before, so a cached track opens with no network at all.
///
/// Retained by its asset (see ``AudioStreamCache/makeAsset(for:source:options:)``), because an
/// `AVAssetResourceLoader` holds its delegate weakly.
///
/// **Network failures.** A hole whose fetch fails for want of a network is retried after each of
/// `retryDelays` before the request is failed, as ExoPlayer's load-error policy retried a failed
/// read. Two cases need it: a connection that drops for a moment mid-track, and AVFoundation's
/// habit of asking for the whole file and cancelling once it has read the header. Offline, with the
/// header cached, failing that request at the first hole fails the asset even though AVFoundation
/// was about to cancel it; waiting gives it the chance to.
