///
/// The first item gets the full treatment: its opening onto disk first, so it can start the moment
/// it's reached, then the rest of it, so seeking around it is a disk read from the first second it
/// plays. Only that one track, and never bytes for anything further out: full-track bytes for
/// tracks that may never be reached would spend real mobile data on nothing.
///
/// The next ``queueLookahead`` items get a lighter treatment: only their ``AudioCachePrefetchItem/warmUp``
/// (a stream URL minted into the resolver's own cache). That's the gap a fast run of skips falls
/// into — the queue moving faster than a single-track read-ahead can follow — and a resolve costs a
/// handful of small round trips, not a stream's worth of data.
///
/// One, not three, and the difference is not the round trips: on Android, while every player
/// client was being refused, every warm-up fell through to the one extraction path that collapses
/// when run concurrently (1.8 s alone against 30.3 s with three in flight), which cost the track the
/// listener was waiting on a thirty-second start.
///
/// What the caller decides (these rules lived in `prefetchQueue` on Android, next to state the
/// cache no longer owns): leave out downloaded and source-backed tracks that play from elsewhere;
/// pass a nil ``AudioCachePrefetchItem/source`` for a track whose substitution isn't pinned yet, or
/// that the listener reverted to YouTube's original (which plays from its own `#original` entry),
/// so read-ahead can't write bytes under a key playback won't read.
