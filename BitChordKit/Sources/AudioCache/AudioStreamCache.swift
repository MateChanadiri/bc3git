// Ports playback/AudioCache.kt (the object the rest of the app talks to).

/// On-disk cache of the audio itself, and the read-ahead that fills it.
///
/// Two problems, one cache:
///
///  - **Seeking.** Everything played is written to disk on the way through, so seeking back is
///    always a file read. Seeking *forward* past what the player has buffered is the gap, and it
///    closes once a track is on disk in full — which is why read-ahead fetches whole tracks rather
///    than openings.
///  - **Track changes.** The next track needs a stream URL resolved before its first byte can even
///    be asked for. Fetching it ahead of time moves all of that off the gap between songs.
///
/// Playback asks for an asset by ``AudioCacheKey`` (track identity, never a URL; see there for
/// why) and a byte source. AVFoundation then reads the custom-scheme URL through an
/// `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate` that answers from disk and fills holes from the source — lazily,
/// so a track already cached never resolves a URL. A fully cached track therefore plays with no
/// network at all (airplane mode).
///
/// ```swift
/// let cache = try AudioStreamCache()
/// let source = HTTPAudioSource(onRefused: resolver.noteRefused) {
///     try await resolver.resolveStream(for: song, request: request)
/// }
/// let item = AVPlayerItem(asset: cache.makeAsset(for: .youtube(videoId: song.videoId), source: source))
/// ```
///
/// iOS differences from Android:
///  - There is no single-writer lock (fetches are shared, see ``AudioCacheStore``), so the
///    read-ahead's lock probe and lost-race retries are gone.
///  - The key is chosen by the caller rather than derived from global settings inside the cache.
///  - Eviction also respects free space on the volume.
///  - YouTube's fragmented MP4 has its declared durations zeroed on the way to disk, or
///    AVFoundation would report twice the track's length (see ``FragmentedMP4Durations``).
///  - A player read that hits a hole with no network is retried a few times before it fails
///    (``Configuration/networkRetryDelays``), as ExoPlayer's load-error policy did.
///  - Android's one-off purge of `#alt` entries written before its matcher fix is not carried
///    over: no iOS install has such entries.
