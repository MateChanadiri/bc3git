/// Least-recently-used eviction whose ceiling can move, with the opening of each track held back.

/// The ceiling is a `var` so a settings change takes effect on the cache already open (and in use
/// by the player) rather than needing a new one; ``applyNow()`` reclaims space the moment the limit
/// drops, rather than whenever the listener next happens to play something.
///
/// ## Why the opening of a track is treated differently
///
/// Plain LRU has a pathology here. A track's first bytes are read once, when playback starts, and
/// never touched again; its tail is read continuously as the listener keeps listening. So the head
/// is always the oldest span a track owns, and plain LRU always evicts it first. Measured on the
/// Android reference device with a full cache: 48 of 170 spans still began at byte 0 — most tracks
/// were sitting on disk almost complete, with their openings gone.
///
/// That is invisible for playback, which re-fetches whatever it needs. It is fatal for Automix,
/// whose analyzer can only decode from the start of a container: a track holding 95% of itself but
/// nothing at byte 0 reads as entirely uncached. Worse, with the cache at its ceiling a track
/// downloading its own tail could evict its own head while still playing.
///
/// So head spans are held back from eviction, up to `headBudgetBytes` in total. The budget
/// matters: heads are never re-read, so nothing would ever age them out, and an unbounded exemption
/// would fill the cache with openings. Past the budget the oldest protected head is released back
/// to ordinary LRU, which is both a bound and roughly the right policy — the tracks played longest
/// ago are the ones least likely to come round again.
///
/// Pure bookkeeping: it decides which spans go, and the store deletes them.
