// Ports the key factory in playback/AudioCache.kt.

/// Which entry of the audio cache a stream's bytes belong to.
///
/// The cache is keyed by track identity, never by URL. googlevideo URLs are single-use, expire
/// within hours and differ between resolves of the same track, so keying on them would cache every
/// track afresh on every play. Because the key is known *before* anything is resolved, a track that
/// is already on disk plays without resolving a URL at all, which is what makes replaying a cached
/// song in airplane mode work.
///
/// One track can own several entries, one per rendition (format): YouTube's own stream, whatever a
/// higher-ranked source substitutes for it (`#alt`), and a quality upgrade that replaces that
/// mid-track (`#<tag>`). Sharing one entry between them survives neither a reorder nor a
/// half-cached track: the next play would serve a FLAC prefix and then stream Opus into the middle
/// of it. Each gets its own entry, and the duplication costs a re-download rather than a corrupt
/// file. The cache also checks every response's total length against the entry's (see
/// ``AudioCacheError/contentChanged(key:expected:actual:)``), so a key reused for a different file
/// is caught rather than spliced.
///
/// The raw form matches Android's so logs and summaries read the same: `videoId`,
/// `videoId#rendition`, or `source|track[#rendition]` for a source-backed track.
