/// An HTTP(S) stream as a byte source, fetched as a run of bounded ranges instead of one
/// open-ended read.
///
/// googlevideo paces a continuous response down to roughly playback speed: ask for a whole track in
/// one request and it arrives at about 15 kB/s, barely ahead of the rate it is being consumed at.
/// Ask for the same bytes as bounded ranges and each one is served at line rate — measured on the
/// same track, over the same connection, seconds apart:
///
/// ```
///   GET (unbounded)               15.5 kB/s
///   Range: bytes=0-2097151         5.7 MB/s
/// ```
///
/// That is the difference between a player that can build a buffer and one that can only just keep
/// up. So every request this makes is at most ``defaultChunkBytes`` long, narrowed per client by
/// ``rangeBytes(for:)`` (googlevideo refuses ANDROID_VR and TVHTML5_SIMPLY ranges past 512 KB).
/// Longer asks are split, so no caller can exceed the limit. Hosts other than googlevideo aren't
/// throttled that way and get one request per ask, as Android forwarded them unchanged.
///
/// **Headers.** Every request carries the stream's ``ResolvedStream/headers``: googlevideo compares
/// the client baked into the URL with the request fetching the bytes, and throttles or refuses a
/// mismatch; WebDAV needs its Authorization.
///
/// **Expired and refused URLs.** Resolved URLs expire and get re-minted. Every refused range is
/// reported to `onRefused` with its status — the one piece of evidence a resolver needs to retire
/// the client that minted it (StreamResolver's `onPlaybackRefused(url:statusCode:)` fits as is) —
/// and when the status says the URL itself is dead (403, 404, 410) and a resolver closure was
/// given, the URL is re-minted and the range asked again, once per range. A URL already past its `expire` is re-minted before use. A
/// re-minted URL that names a file of a different length throws
/// ``AudioCacheError/contentChanged(key:expected:actual:)`` rather than splicing two encodings.
///
/// **Lazy resolving.** Built with ``init(session:chunkBytes:onRefused:resolve:)`` the URL is only
/// resolved when bytes are actually missing, so a track the cache already holds never costs a
/// resolve (on Android the cache sat outside the resolving data source for the same reason).
