/// Gets a track's opening onto disk for Automix, and says when there is enough of it.
///
/// ## Why the analyzer has to ask for this
///
/// Nothing else fetches a track's opening early enough. Read-ahead writes no bytes for a track
/// whose substitution isn't pinned, and a quality upgrade fetches its rendition from the swap point
/// onward, so a track that plays lossless from the start would otherwise never have a measurable
/// opening at all.
///
/// ## Why it fetches once, at full size
///
/// An earlier Android version started at a megabyte and grew the request on each later call. Every
/// round resolves the stream again, and a resolver doesn't promise the same file twice: round one
/// wrote a megabyte of one encoding, round two skipped what was cached and wrote the remainder of a
/// *different* one into the same entry — a complete-looking file that decodes for fourteen seconds
/// of a 153-second container. One resolve, one range, one encoding: the size is decided once from
/// the real length (``headSize(total:)``), and a part-filled entry is cleared before anything is
/// written to it (``clearPartialHead(_:want:)``). A copy that turns out undecodable is deleted
/// rather than remembered (``AudioStreamCache/discardBadRendition(_:playing:)``), which also re-arms
/// this for the track.
