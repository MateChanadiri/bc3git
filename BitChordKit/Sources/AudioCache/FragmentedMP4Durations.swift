/// YouTube's audio renditions (itag 139/140) are fragmented MP4: `ftyp`, a `moov` whose `mvex`
/// says the samples live in fragments, a `sidx`, then `moof`/`mdat` pairs. The `moov` still
/// declares the whole track's duration in `mvhd`, `tkhd` and `mdhd`, and AVFoundation adds the
/// fragments on top of that declaration: dQw4w9WgXcQ reports 426.13 s against 213.04 s of audio,
/// so the seek bar runs to 7:06 and playback stops at 3:33.
///
/// The zeroing itself is StreamResolution's `YouTubeMP4InitSegment.patchDurations(in:)` — the one
/// canonical fix, shared with Downloads — applied here only to sources that opt in via
/// `AudioRangeDataSource/requiresYouTubeDurationFix` (YouTube-origin streams, and downloaded
/// YouTube files flagged as such). It additionally runs only on a `moov` that carries an `mvex`:
/// an ordinary MP4 (an addon's M4A, a file the user imported) declares its real duration there,
/// and zeroing it would break that file instead. Only header fields change; no sample data does.
///
