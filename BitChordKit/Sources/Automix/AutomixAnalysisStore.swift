/// Analysis results kept on disk, so a track is measured once and stays measured.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// In memory only, every app start threw away everything and every track had to earn its result
/// again — from audio that may no longer be on disk to earn it from, at the cost of a decode plus
/// two model inferences that have to finish *before* the transition that wants them. Neither
/// applies to a result already computed. The audio is a means to the numbers, and the numbers are
/// small.
///
/// ## Shape
///
/// One JSON file per track in an injectable directory, named by track id rather than written into
/// a single index, so a write cannot corrupt anything but its own entry and a prune is a file
/// delete. Coordinates are seconds on the track's own timeline, identical across renditions of the
/// same recording. Only fields the planner reads are stored, and the curves are rounded to
/// milliseconds: they are the bulk of the payload and nothing downstream can tell the difference.
