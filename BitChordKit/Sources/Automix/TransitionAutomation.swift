///   fully open by 60% of the fade — the two hand the midrange over instead of doubling it.
/// - ``TransitionStyle/djBlend`` with a bass swap: below 200 Hz exactly one track is present at
///   any instant; the low end changes hands at ``TransitionPlan/bassSwapFraction`` over a tenth of
///   the fade. The incoming entry high-pass (520 Hz, 950 Hz at a full vocal collision) and a
///   shallow outgoing exit low-pass (to 2.2 kHz, 1.1 kHz at full collision) keep two lead vocals

///   ``TransitionPlan/vocalOverlap`` says two vocals collide, in which case a restrained version of
///   the filter ride (outgoing to 1.6 kHz, incoming from 700 Hz) scaled by the collision.
/// - ``TransitionStyle/gapless``: always open; an album played through gets no edits.
///
