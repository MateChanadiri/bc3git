///   socket so the loop builds a new one.

///   gateway session's lifetime and discards it when the session ends, so the
///   last presence (`lastPresence`) is replayed as soon as a new session is
///   ready.
///
/// iOS backgrounding: the system suspends sockets when the app is suspended.
/// Presence updates therefore only flow while the app runs — in practice,
