// Ports data/stats/ListeningStats.kt: what this device has listened to, kept on this device.
//
// ## Aggregates, not an event log
//
// The obvious shape for listening history is a row per play, summed up when something asks. It is
// also the shape that grows without bound on a phone nobody is going to garbage-collect. So the
// addition happens on the way in: a track's total is a counter that goes up while it plays, and
// reading the Replay is a merge of a handful of already finished sums. The cost is what any
// aggregate costs — the raw plays are gone, so a question nobody thought of in advance cannot be
// answered later. Every question Replay asks is here.
//
// ## One file per month
//
// Buckets are calendar months in the device's own time zone, one JSON file each, under
// Application Support/BitChord/Replay/Listening. That is what makes "this year" and "all time"
// the same operation on different numbers of files. A month is also the granularity below which
// nothing on the Replay page asks a question; days are still counted, as a total per day inside
// the bucket, which is enough for "your biggest day" without a file per day to get there.
//
// ## Storage: JSON files, not SQLite
//
// A full bucket is capped at 600 tracks and 400 artists/albums each — well under a hundred
// kilobytes — and at most 36 are kept. The only reads are "load whole month" and "list months",
// the only writes are whole-month rewrites every few samples. SQLite would add a schema, a query
// planner and a migration story for a workload that is a dozen small JSON files; Core's
// `JSONFileStore` (atomic write-to-temp-then-rename, so a kill mid-write leaves the previous
// month rather than a truncated one) is the whole persistence story.
//
// ## Threading
//
// All methods are synchronous and serialized on an internal lock; call them off the main thread.
// `record` never touches the disk — `flush` writes the dirty months — and `summary` flushes first
// so the page agrees with what has just been playing.

/// The sink `ReplayListeningRecorder` writes through. `ReplayListeningStats` conforms; tests use a spy.
