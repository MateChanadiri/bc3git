// Ports data/stats/ListeningRecorder.kt: turns the player's ticking into the numbers
// ReplayListeningStats keeps.
//
// ## Why it samples rather than measures
//
// The tempting implementation reads the track's position when it ends and calls that the
// listening. It is wrong in every direction that matters: a track skipped at 0:20 reports twenty
// seconds it did play, a track seeked back over reports less than it played, a track left paused
// for an hour reports the same as one played through, and a track the process is killed under
// reports nothing at all.
//
// So this is fed from the player's existing progress sampler, which only ticks while audio is
// actually coming out, and each tick contributes the *wall-clock* time since the last one. Seeking
// cannot inflate it because position is never consulted. Pausing cannot inflate it because no tick
// happens. The gap either side of a pause is capped at `maxStepMs`, which is what stops an hour on
// the lock screen from arriving as an hour of listening on the first tick after resume.
//
// The cost is that the few seconds before the first tick of each track are not counted — a
// systematic undercount of at most one sample interval per track, and the right way to be wrong:
// every alternative overcounts, and a Replay that flatters is worth less than one that is a
// little shy.
//
// ## Minutes and plays are different questions
//
// Minutes accumulate continuously. A *play* is counted once, when enough of the track has gone by
// to call it listened to — the same half-or-four-minutes rule the scrobbler uses, so the two never
// disagree about what a play is.
