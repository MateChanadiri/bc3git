// Ports data/stats/ArtistFacts.kt: what the Replay knows about an artist beyond their name —
// their picture, their page, and what kind of music they make.
//
// ## Why any of this needs looking up
//
// Listening is counted per *name*, because a name is the only thing every track carries. That is
// enough to rank artists and nothing else: every track carries its own sleeve (an artist chart
// illustrated with album covers reads as the page having drawn the wrong list), a browse id only
// rides along when the row that queued the track happened to have one, and nothing this app talks
// to states a genre.
//
// ## One store, two sources, two gates
//
// The picture and the page come from a YouTube Music artist search, which the app is already
// talking to constantly. The genre comes from Last.fm's `artist.getTopTags` and *is* gated
// (`genresEnabled`, wired by the app to the `replayGenres` setting and its Last.fm key): it sends
// an artist's name and nothing else, and turned off, the genre chart simply isn't drawn while
// every other chart is unaffected.
//
// Both are asked once per artist and kept on this device for good.
//
// ## iOS shape
//
// Android runs a serial worker with a 1.5 s spacing and a 5 s save timer. This class keeps the
// policy (what is worth asking, once per artist, miss expiry, caps) but leaves the scheduling to
// the app: `noticed(_:)` queues, and the app drains the queue with `resolvePending()` (for
// example from a background task while music plays — enrichment must never cost a stream a
// millisecond of latency). Network access arrives as two injected closures, so this module stays
// offline-testable and the Last.fm JSON parsing lives with the app's networking.
