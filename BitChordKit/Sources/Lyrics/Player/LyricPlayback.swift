/// should have reached in the elapsed wall-clock time. Ordinary polling and main-thread
/// delay stay monotonic; an actual seek is still a large discontinuity and resets at once.
///
/// Create one per track (Android keyed it on the track); between reports, advance the
/// displayed clock from the latest report plus the frame time elapsed since it arrived,
/// never backwards: `displayed = max(displayed, reported + (now - observedAt))`.
