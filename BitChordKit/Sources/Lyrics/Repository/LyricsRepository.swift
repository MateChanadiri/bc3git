/// Where the player gets its lyrics.
///
/// Sixteen sources (`LyricsSource`), tried in the user's priority order:
///  - BiniLyrics, BetterLyrics and PaxSenix — Apple Music TTML, per-syllable, from
///    independent hosts so one having a bad day doesn't cost the timing.
///  - LyricsPlus — the YouLy+ backend; finest timing of the lot, flakiest hosting.
///  - SimpMusic — keyed on the video id, so it can't fetch the wrong edit.
///  - Unison — contributed rather than licensed; thin, occasionally the only place a track exists.
///  - LRCLIB, Musixmatch, KuGou, Megalobiz — line-synced, but between them almost always up.
///  - YouTube captions and the YouTube Music Lyrics tab — keyed on the playing video.
///  - Genius — plain text, last resort.
///
/// Every enabled source is asked *at the same time*, but their answers are taken in order:
/// the loop awaits them one at a time in that sequence, so a lower-priority source finishing
/// first never preempts one still pending ahead of it. Asked one after another instead, a
/// miss on each source would cost its own round trip before the next was even tried, and a
/// track with no lyrics anywhere would spend the best part of a minute finding that out.
///
/// A word-timed answer wins outright. Failing that, a line-timed one is taken from the
/// highest-priority source that had it — better a whole line lighting up in sync than the
/// right animation on lyrics that don't exist.
///
/// ### Matching on the recording
///
/// Everything above matches a *name*, and a name is ambiguous in a way that matters: a
/// single and its album cut share a title, an artist and very nearly a length, and
/// routinely differ in the words. An ISRC names one recording and settles it. BiniLyrics
/// and LyricsPlus accept one, and BiniLyrics is also the one that hands them out.
///
/// So the recording is settled *before* anybody is asked for words: one small search
/// against BiniLyrics, capped at `identifyTimeout` and remembered against the video id — a
/// track asked about twice pays for this once. A downloaded or local file can skip it: its
/// own tags name the recording (`LyricsTrack.isrc`).
///
/// Only run when BiniLyrics is enabled. A source somebody has turned off is a source this
/// app does not contact — not even for something it would only use to help the others.
