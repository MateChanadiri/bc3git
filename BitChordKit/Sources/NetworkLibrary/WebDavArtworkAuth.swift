// never passes through the app HTTP client's auth interceptor — so without
// it every in-app cover went out without `Authorization`, came back 401, and
// read as "this track has no artwork". On iOS the same applies to any image
// loader that doesn't share the app's session: the loader asks here for the
// header to attach. Runs per image request, so it decides on strings alone
// and touches nothing else.
