// Ports data/webdav/WebDavUploads.kt and WebDavUploadNotifications.kt:
// copies on-device tracks to the configured WebDAV server. Copy, not move:
// the local file stays where it was, so this never needs delete permission
// — the server copy simply shows up in the WebDAV library on its next
// listing.
//
// One batch runs sequentially. Parallel PUTs would finish sooner on Wi-Fi
// and fall over on a metered connection, and ordering is what makes a
// multi-conflict batch answerable: each clash suspends on `onConflict`, the
// app's dialog answers it, and an "apply to all" answer carries the rest of
// the batch without another popup.
//
// Android posts an ongoing notification row while bytes move; iOS has no
// ongoing notifications (PORTING.md §4), so progress stays in-app — `states`
// streams per-track fractions for the upload sheet — and only the batch
// result may surface as a local notification, when the app opts in via a
// ``WebDavUploadNotifying`` and the user granted notification permission.
