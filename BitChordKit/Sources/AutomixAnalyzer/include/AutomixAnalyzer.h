// Plain C face of the native Automix analyzer (analyzer/*.cpp, kept as the
// Android build compiles it).
//
// This is the iOS counterpart of app/src/main/cpp/jni/*.cpp. It is C rather
// than C++ on purpose: Swift imports a C header as an ordinary Clang module,
// so nothing that depends on the Automix module has to turn on Swift/C++
// interoperability to use it.
//
// Ownership: every pointer returned here is allocated with malloc and must be
// released with bc_automix_free. A NULL return always means "no result" (the
// analyzer declined the input, or allocation failed), never an error to throw;
// the Swift side reads it as "no evidence", which is what the transition
// policy already degrades on.
//
// Every call borrows its input only until it returns and is reentrant. The
// work is O(n) to O(n log n) and allocates, so it belongs on a worker thread,
// never on a real-time audio thread.
