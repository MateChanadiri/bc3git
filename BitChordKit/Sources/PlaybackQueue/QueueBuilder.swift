/// Two problems this exists to solve:
///
///  - YouTube's watch queues routinely carry the same recording twice — the official audio and the
///    music video are separate videoIds with near identical titles — so de-duping on id alone lets a
///    track play, then play again as its video. Songs are matched on a normalised title plus lead
///    artist instead.
///
///  - A radio mix leans hard on the seed's own artist. Capping how many tracks any one artist
///    contributes keeps a station from turning into a single artist's discography.
