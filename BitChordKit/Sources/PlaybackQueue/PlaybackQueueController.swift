// Ports the queue half of playback/PlaybackService.kt (transition bookkeeping, AutoPlay, repeat,
// shuffle toggle, restart persistence, stations, the session's queue-jump rule), the queue
// operations MainActivity.kt performs through the MediaController (play, play next, add to queue,
// start radio, jump, remove, move, clear, dislike skip) and PlayerConnection.kt's playSongs.

/// The playback queue: the one owner of what plays next.
///
/// On Android the queue lives in ExoPlayer, and the service reacts to its callbacks. Here the queue
/// is a plain model the playback engine follows: the engine loads whatever
/// ``onCurrentItemChange`` names, and reports back through ``trackDidFinish()`` and
/// ``recordPlayhead(positionMs:isPlaying:)``. Every rule the service applied on a transition —
/// bounded history, consuming played user-queue entries, topping AutoPlay up, persisting the
/// restart snapshot — runs here, whichever path moved the queue.
///
/// Two kinds of edit, as on Android:
/// - **User intents** (``playFrom(_:index:source:)``, ``playNext(_:)``, ``jump(to:)``,
///   ``removeFromQueue(at:)`` …) are refused while a party's host has locked control, and report
///   ``onLocalIntent`` so a party can publish them.
/// - **Programmatic edits** (``setItems(_:startIndex:startPositionMs:playback:)``,
///   ``insertItems(_:at:)``, ``removeItems(in:)``, ``moveItem(from:to:)``,
///   ``replaceItems(in:with:)``, ``seek(toItem:positionMs:)``) are what a sync layer uses to
///   reconcile the queue with a party's. They are never refused and never reported.
///
/// Set ``onCurrentItemChange`` before calling ``restore()``, and call
/// ``flushPersistence(positionMs:isPlaying:)`` when the app leaves the foreground.
