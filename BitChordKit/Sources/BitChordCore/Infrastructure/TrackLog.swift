/// The app's own record of how each track came to be playing, as text a user can paste ("Copy
/// log" in the player).
///
/// Diagnosing why a track played from the wrong source, at the wrong bitrate, or not at all used to
/// mean reading the system log, and the answer is usually in a few seconds that scrolled past before
/// anyone noticed. This keeps those lines, in memory, bounded by size.
///
/// **What to log here:** only the paths that decide how a track plays — the resolver, the source
/// ladder, the cache and the player. Not feeds, artwork, lyrics or the library (use ``DebugLog``):
/// a paste that includes everything is one nobody reads to the end of.
///
/// **Whose line is it.** Every line is filed against the track it is about, because a track's work
/// happens nowhere near the moment it plays: it is resolved while the one before it plays, and the
/// first seconds of every track are spent resolving the next. Wrap a track's work in
/// ``about(_:operation:)`` (a task-local, so it follows every child task) instead of threading ids
/// through every layer:
///
/// ```swift
/// try await TrackLog.about(song.videoId) { try await resolver.resolveStream(for: song, request: r) }
/// ```
///
/// Lines are mirrored to `os.Logger` (subsystem `com.music.bitchord`, the given category) in debug
/// builds, and every line of ``shared`` goes to the log file in every build (``DiagnosticLog``).
