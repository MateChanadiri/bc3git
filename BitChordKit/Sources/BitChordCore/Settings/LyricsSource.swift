// Ports the LyricsSource enum from data/lyrics/LyricsSource.kt. It lives in Core because
// AppSettings persists the enabled set and the order by these names, and needs the full list to
// tell a source the user switched off from one added by an upgrade. The Lyrics module maps each
// case to its provider implementation.

/// One lyrics database the user can switch on, off and reorder.
///
/// Declaration order (``allCases``) is the default priority. Stored by name (raw value), so this
/// list can be rearranged without disturbing an order somebody already chose. The three Apple hosts
/// lead because their catalogue carries the voices; BiniLyrics goes first because it answers to a
/// recording rather than a name and is where the ISRC the others use comes from.
