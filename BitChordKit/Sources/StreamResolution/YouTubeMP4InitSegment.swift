/// A fix for how AVFoundation reads YouTube's AAC files. No Android counterpart: ExoPlayer reads
/// these files correctly.
///
/// YouTube's audio renditions (itag 139/140) are fragmented MP4: an init segment (`ftyp`,
/// `moov`), a `sidx`, then `moof`/`mdat` fragments. Its `moov` declares the *whole* track's
/// duration in `mvhd`, `tkhd` and `mdhd`, although the samples all live in the fragments.
/// AVFoundation treats that declaration as un-fragmented media and adds the fragments on top, so
/// every track reports about twice its length — measured 2026-09-26 on dQw4w9WgXcQ itag 140:
/// `AVURLAsset.duration` 426.13 s over HTTP and from a local copy, against 213.04 s of audio
/// (afinfo agrees with the latter). The seek bar would run to 7:06 and playback stop at 3:33.
///
/// Zeroing the track's declared durations (`tkhd`, `mdhd`; `mvhd` too, for consistency) makes
/// AVFoundation take the duration from the fragments alone — measured: 213.04 s. The bytes
/// patched are header fields only; no sample data changes.
///
/// Where to apply it: whoever hands these bytes to AVPlayer — the Playback module's resource
/// loader when it serves the first range, and the Downloads module after writing a file. The
/// init segment is always inside the first kilobyte or two, so patching the first chunk read
/// from offset 0 is enough. `ResolvedYouTubeStream.approxDurationMs` is the authoritative length
/// meanwhile.
public enum YouTubeMP4InitSegment {
    /// Zeroes the declared durations in the fragmented `moov` at the start of `data` (which
    /// must begin at file offset 0). Boxes cut off by the end of `data` are left alone.
    ///
    /// Only fragmented files are patched: the `moov` must carry an `mvex` box, the marker
    /// that samples live in `moof` fragments rather than in the movie itself. Zeroing the
    /// declared durations of a progressive MP4 would destroy real duration metadata instead
    /// of fixing double-duration, so such a `moov` reads as "nothing to do" and returns 0.
    ///
    /// - Returns: how many duration fields were zeroed (0 when `data` holds no such `moov`, or
    ///   they were already zero), so a caller can tell a patched file from an untouched one.
