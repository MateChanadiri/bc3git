///
/// On Android the processor removes silent frames from the stream before they
/// reach the output. An `MTAudioProcessingTap` sees an `AVPlayer`'s audio but
/// cannot shorten the item's timeline, so on iOS this reports instead, and
/// Playback moves the player:
///
/// - **Ahead of time** — for audio that can be decoded before it plays (a
///   download, a cached file), feed it through a detector (or `scan`) and seek
///   over each span's `skipRange` when playback reaches it. This matches
///   Android exactly: the same frames are heard.
/// - **Live**, from the tap — watch `nextEvent()` / `phase`. On `.started` the
///   silence is confirmed; on `.discarding` Android would be dropping
///   everything, so call `expectSeek(toFrame:)` and seek ahead (or advance to
///   the next item if this is the run-out); on `.ended` sound is back. Telling
///   the detector about the seek first keeps the run open across the jump, so
///   one silence stays one span however many seeks it takes.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// `process`, `finish` and `flush` run on the audio thread (or on whatever
/// single thread is decoding offline) and never allocate or lock. Events are
/// handed over through a fixed-size single-producer/single-consumer ring:
/// `nextEvent()` must be called from one consumer thread at a time.
