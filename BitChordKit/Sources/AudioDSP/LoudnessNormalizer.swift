/// or switches the effect off when the setting is off or no figure is known.
/// `gainMillibels(forLoudnessDb:)` is that computation exactly.

/// `LoudnessEnhancer` is more than a multiply. AOSP's implementation
/// (`EffectLoudnessEnhancer.cpp`, `dynamic_range_compression.cpp`) applies the
/// gain on the input of a feed-forward compressor — knee at -8 dBFS for every
/// gain BitChord can ask for, 7:1 ratio, 1 ms attack, 15 ms release, stereo
/// linked — and hard-limits at ±32767/32768. This stage ports that compressor
/// sample for sample, including its fast-log approximation, so a track lands
/// at the level it lands at on Android. The compressor is reset whenever a
/// gain is applied, as `setTargetGain` resets it there.
///
/// Android runs the effect on the whole session, after its per-player DSP; the
/// iOS chain runs it last for the same reason, but per player item, so during a
/// crossfade each side keeps its own track's gain rather than sharing one.
///
/// Mono and multichannel streams are linked across every channel, which is
