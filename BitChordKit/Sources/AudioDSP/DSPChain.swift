/// BitChord's audio processors in their canonical order, run in place on Float32 PCM:
///
///     spatial widening → equaliser → transition filter → [silence detection] → loudness normalization
///
/// Transition filtering comes last of the three filters: widening is a property
/// of the track, and a bass swap that ran before it would have its own low end
/// fed back in by the cross-feed — or by whatever the listener's low band was
/// set to. The equaliser sits between them for the same reason: it belongs to
/// the listener and the whole session, while the transition filter belongs to
/// one handoff and has to have the last word on it.
///
/// Silence detection sees the filtered signal and loudness normalization runs
/// after everything, matching where Android's Media3 silence skipper (in the
/// sink, after the DSP chain) and `LoudnessEnhancer` (a session effect, after
/// the sink) sit.
///
/// ## Staying out of the way
///
/// Every stage self-bypasses when its setting is off, returning before it
/// reads a sample rather than multiplying through by unity. With every stage
/// idle the audio leaves this chain bit-identical to how it arrived.
///
/// ## Use from a processing tap
///
/// `configure` from the tap's prepare callback, `process(bufferList:...)` from
/// its process callback, `reset` from unprepare — or let
/// `makeAudioProcessingTap()` do that wiring. Settings (`apply`, and each
/// stage's own setters) are safe from any thread at any time.
