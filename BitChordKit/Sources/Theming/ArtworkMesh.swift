/// quantiser what colours a sleeve is *about* and paints four blobs of them.
/// That is why a cover that is nine-tenths black with a red stripe came out as a
/// red screen — the quantiser reports red because red is the interesting answer,
/// and nothing downstream knows how little of the picture it was. It also has no
/// idea *where* in the frame that red was.
///
/// This is the other approach: no quantiser at all. The sleeve is averaged into a
/// ``gridSize``-square grid of means; the row against the seam is kept in place,
/// and everything below it is flipped and then rotated sideways (see
/// `rotatedBelowSeam`). What the backdrop holds is the cover's own colours,
/// roughly in the cover's own proportions (nine-tenths black stays nine-tenths
/// black) and with each cell's neighbours exactly what they were in the source,
/// but not lined up in the cover's own *position*: a flip on its own reads as a
/// reflection on any cover with real structure to it — a face, a horizon, a
/// logo — because the layout still lines up column for column with what's on
/// screen above it. The rotation is what breaks that; the coarseness keeps any
/// one cell from being recognisable on its own.
