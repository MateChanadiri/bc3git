// Ports download/FlacTagger.kt.

/// Rewrites a FLAC's metadata blocks to carry title, artist, album, lyrics and cover art.
///
/// The simplest of the taggers, and the reason is worth stating. A FLAC is `fLaC`, then a chain of
/// length-prefixed metadata blocks, then the audio frames — and nothing in the format addresses
/// anything by an absolute file offset. `SEEKTABLE` *looks* like the exception, but its offsets are
/// measured from the first frame header rather than from the start of the file, so growing the
/// metadata region moves the frames without invalidating a single number in it. The whole job is to
/// emit a new block chain and copy the frames through untouched.
///
/// What comes out is the magic, `STREAMINFO`, every other block the file already had, then a fresh
/// `VORBIS_COMMENT` and `PICTURE`. The old copies of those two are dropped rather than added to — a
/// second `VORBIS_COMMENT` is illegal, and two front covers is a coin toss over which one a player
/// shows. `PADDING` is dropped as well, which is what it is there for.
///
/// AVFoundation reads the result: `vorb/TITLE`, `vorb/ARTIST`, `vorb/ALBUM`, `vorb/LYRICS`,
/// `vorb/BITCHORD_LYRICS`, and the `PICTURE` block as `vorb/METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE` artwork
/// (verified on macOS 27).
///
/// Anything that doesn't fit the shape above — no `fLaC`, a block that claims more bytes than the
/// file has, a first block that isn't `STREAMINFO` — returns nil, so the downloaded file is left
/// alone.
