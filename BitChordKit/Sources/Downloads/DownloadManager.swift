/// ### What happens to a tap
///
/// ``enqueue(_:from:)`` (or ``download(_:as:)`` for a whole album or playlist) puts the track in the
/// queue and returns. Up to ``Configuration/workers`` tracks run at once (four, as on Android:
/// working out where a lossless track's bytes come from is tens of seconds of *latency*, so the
/// answer is overlap). Each job:
///
/// 1. waits for a connection the Wi-Fi-only setting allows (``isWaitingForWiFi``);
/// 2. resolves a stream through the injected `StreamResolving` at
///    `StreamRequest.download(settings.downloadQuality)` — Standard is capped at 128 kbps, High is
///    the best lossy rung, Lossless asks sources for their bit-exact file;
/// 3. decides how to save it (``DownloadRoute``): googlevideo as ranged requests, a source's file in
///    one GET, an HLS or DASH manifest flattened into one fragmented `.m4a`;
/// 4. transfers through background `URLSession` download tasks while the lyrics lookup and the
///    cover fetch run alongside;
/// 5. tags the part file (``Mp4Tagger`` / ``FlacTagger``), renames it into place, and records it
///    in the ``library``.
///
/// ### iOS differences
///
/// - **No foreground service.** Transfers are background download tasks (PORTING.md §4), so they
///   continue while the app is suspended, and the queue itself is persisted (`queue.json`) with a
///   checkpoint after every range or segment. Constructing the manager at launch restores it: a job
///   picks up at its last whole range, joining a transfer still in flight or collecting one that
///   finished while the app wasn't running. Forward
///   `application(_:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:)` to
///   ``handleBackgroundEvents(identifier:completion:)``.
/// - **Wi-Fi only waits instead of refusing.** Android failed the row with "Downloads are set to
///   Wi-Fi only". PORTING.md's acceptance test is "with Wi-Fi only on, downloads wait while on
///   cellular": the queue holds (``isWaitingForWiFi``) and every request is sent with
///   `allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess`/`allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess` off, so even a transfer the
///   system runs while the app is suspended waits for Wi-Fi. Offline is let through, as on Android:
///   refusing there would blame a Wi-Fi setting for an outage.
/// - **No catalogue swap and no source fallback here.** The composed resolver the app injects
///   already walks the sources and falls back to YouTube.
/// - **No notification.** Progress is state on this object for the app to draw (PORTING.md §4).
