/// An offline copy of an MPEG-DASH audio manifest.
///
/// ### Why DASH exists here at all
///
/// Because the shape of a module's stream is the backend's choice. The Tidal module served `.m3u8`
/// until September 2026 and `.mpd` afterwards — same track, same tier. Before this existed on
/// Android a `.mpd` went down the ordinary fetch-and-save path and wrote **2,738 bytes of XML into a
/// file called `Artist - Track.flac`**: a download that reported success and could never play.
///
/// ### How iOS saves it (differs from Android)
///
/// Android rewrites the manifest as an HLS playlist over the saved segments, because Media3 plays a
/// local `.m3u8`. AVPlayer only plays offline HLS from a `.movpkg` made by
/// `AVAssetDownloadURLSession`, which can't be fed a DASH manifest. But both manifests describe the
/// same thing — an fMP4 initialisation segment and a run of media segments — and the init segment
/// followed by every segment's `moof`/`mdat` pairs *is* a fragmented MP4 file, which AVPlayer plays
/// from disk and ``Mp4Tagger`` can tag. So the package is flattened into one `.m4a` (see
/// ``Downloader/fetchPackage(jobKey:part:dash:from:hooks:)``). The plan below is identical to Android's; only the output differs.
///
/// ### What is not supported
///
/// Encrypted manifests (`ContentProtection`), multi-period ones and `$Time$` templates — rejected
/// outright rather than half-saved: a package missing part of its audio is worse than a download
/// that says it could not be made, because only the second is recoverable.
