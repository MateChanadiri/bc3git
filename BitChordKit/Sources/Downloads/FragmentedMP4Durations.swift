/// says the samples live in fragments, a `sidx`, then `moof`/`mdat` pairs. The `moov` still
/// declares the whole track's duration in `mvhd`, `tkhd` and `mdhd`, and AVFoundation adds the
/// fragments on top of that declaration — 426.13 s for a 213.04 s track, from a local file as much
/// as over HTTP — so the seek bar runs to twice the song and a downloaded track "ends" halfway.
/// Zeroing those three fields makes it take the duration from the fragments alone. Only header
/// fields change, in place and at the same width, so no offset anywhere in the file moves.

/// repeated here because this module can't depend on either. Like AudioCache's, it only touches a
/// `moov` that has an `mvex`: an ordinary MP4 (a source's ALAC, an AAC file AVAudioFile wrote)
/// declares its real duration there, and zeroing it would break that file instead. Flattened
/// HLS/DASH packages are fragmented too, so they get the same treatment whatever their init
/// segment declared.
