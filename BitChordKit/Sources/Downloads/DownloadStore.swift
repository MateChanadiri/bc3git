///   written. Excluded from iCloud/iTunes backup: every one can be downloaded again, and a backup of
///   a lossless library is gigabytes the user never asked to upload.
/// - `Imported/` — copies of files picked in Files (PORTING.md Q8). *Not* excluded from backup: the
///   user may have deleted the original, and these can't be fetched again.
/// - `Artwork/` — covers saved beside the audio (sidecars keyed by source URL), so the Downloads
///   page draws them offline. Excluded from backup.
/// - `Staging/` — bytes the transfer session has finished but the queue hasn't appended yet
///   (``URLSessionDownloadTransport``). Excluded from backup.
/// - `library.json`, `queue.json` — the records (``DownloadLibrary``, ``DownloadManager``).
