/// Everything downloaded since the app was opened, and whether the user has looked at it yet.

/// The gap this fills is between ``DownloadManager/active`` and the ``DownloadLibrary``. `active` is
/// only ever what is happening *right now* — a track leaves it the instant it finishes, which is
/// exactly the instant the user most wants to know about it — and the library is every file this
/// app has ever written, with nothing to distinguish the album from twenty minutes ago from one from
/// last March. Neither can answer "did the thing I asked for actually all arrive?", and that is the
/// only question a download manager exists to answer.
///
/// Deliberately not persisted. This is a record of one sitting: after a restart what is on disk is
/// the whole truth and the Downloads page is where to read it. (Jobs the queue resumes after a
/// relaunch re-announce themselves through ``queued(_:from:)``.)
///
/// ### Why ``State/visible`` is not just "something is downloading"
///
/// A download is the one thing in this app a user starts and walks away from, so the moment it
/// finishes is a moment nobody is watching. So the indicator stays up until it has been *seen*, and
/// "seen" is compared against when the queue last went quiet rather than being a flag that is set
/// once. Look in halfway, close the sheet, and the last track landing afterwards puts the indicator
/// back — because the thing being confirmed is the *outcome*, and the outcome hadn't happened yet.
