// Ports data/sources/DeviceCodecs.kt. Android asks Media3/MediaCodecList for an E-AC-3 (JOC)
// decoder because that decoder ships with the vendor image; on Apple platforms the equivalent
// question goes to AudioToolbox, which lists the decoders installed for a format ID.

/// What this device can actually decode, asked once and remembered.
///
/// One question so far, and it is the one the rest of the app is otherwise free to ignore all the
/// way to silence: **Dolby Atmos**. Asked before a URL is returned rather than left to the player,
/// because a player handed a format it cannot decode fails badly — on Android as a track that
/// skipped itself instantly; on iOS as an `AVPlayerItem` that fails after the source has already
/// been chosen, costing the fallback budget.
///
/// Every iPhone since the iPhone 7 on iOS 13+ ships an E-AC-3 decoder (Apple decodes Atmos in
/// E-AC-3 JOC for spatial rendering), so on real hardware this is expected to answer yes. The check
/// is kept rather than hard-coded because the Mac host and future simulators need not have it,
/// and a false yes is a silent skip.
///
/// Passthrough to an AV receiver is not considered, for the same reason Android leaves it out: it
/// changes with the audio route and cannot be cached.
