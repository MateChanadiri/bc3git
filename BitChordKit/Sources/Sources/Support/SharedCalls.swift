// Ports data/sources/module/SharedCalls.kt.

/// One in-flight-or-recent answer per key, shared by everyone who asks for it.
///
/// A track passes through this layer several times over — the live resolve, the second look under
/// the music, the lossless pass after a lossy swap, a re-resolve when the player reopens — and
/// every one used to start from nothing: on Android one track was searched twice and asked twice
/// for its stream URL inside ninety seconds, against one module's server.
///
/// Two things are shared, and they are not the same:
/// - **In flight**, always, whatever `ttl` says. Two callers asking the same question at the same
///   moment is the ordinary case here.
/// - **Completed**, for `ttl`. Zero means in-flight only.
///
/// ### Why the work runs in its own task
///
/// This layer's callers are designed to give up: ``SourceResolver`` cancels every source still
/// running once one answers. Run inside the caller's task, each cancellation tore down a request
/// that had already reached somebody's server — which from the far end looks like a client
/// hammering it and hanging up. The work runs in an unstructured `Task`, so a cancelled caller
/// drops its wait and nothing else; the answer lands here, where it is usually wanted again moments
/// later.
///
/// A failure is never kept (a server briefly down is asked again next track). An empty answer is
/// kept: "this catalogue does not have that recording" is a real answer.
