/// This device's offset from the party server's clock.
///
/// Everything the party shares is expressed on the server's timeline — a position and the
/// server time it was true at — so a device that cannot translate that timeline into its
/// own cannot be in sync, however fast its connection is. This is the translation.
///
/// The method is NTP's, cut down to the part that matters over one WebSocket: each sample
/// is a ping stamped on the way out and a pong carrying the server's own reading:
///
/// ```
/// offset     = serverMs - (t0 + t1) / 2
/// roundTrip  = t1 - t0
/// ```
///
/// and the error on that offset is at most half the round trip, because the only thing
/// being assumed is that the two legs took the same time. Which is why the sample with
/// the *smallest* round trip wins rather than the newest or the average: on mobile data a
/// single request delayed behind a radio wake-up is wrong by hundreds of milliseconds, and
/// averaging folds that error in instead of discarding it. A short burst of pings on
/// connect therefore converges faster than a long series would.
///
/// The local half of every sample is a monotonic clock (`ProcessInfo.systemUptime`), not
/// the wall clock. The wall clock is stepped — by the network operator, by the user
/// setting the time, by a DST change — and any step lands directly in the offset and moves
/// this device's playhead relative to everyone else's. The monotonic clock counts since
/// boot through deep sleep, which is exactly the timeline a playhead should be measured
/// against. (Ports `ServerClock` in `data/listentogether/ServerClock.kt`; Android reads
/// `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime`, the same monotonic timeline.)
