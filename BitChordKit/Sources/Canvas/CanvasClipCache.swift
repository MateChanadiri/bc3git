/// Disk cache for canvas clips — the looping video some releases publish alongside a track,
/// played over the cover art in a looping `AVPlayerLayer` (Android: `CanvasCache` in
/// `data/canvas/CanvasCache.kt`).
///
/// Why a cache at all: a five-second clip behind a four-minute track loops around fifty
/// times, and without a cache every loop re-downloads the same few seconds of video — the
/// "40MB for one song" reports trace to exactly this repeat, not to audio bitrate. Serving
/// the clip from disk after the first loop ends that.
///
/// iOS difference: Android wraps ExoPlayer's data source so the player itself reads through
/// the cache. `AVPlayer` has no such hook, so this cache sits one level up: `localFile(for:)`
/// answers the on-disk copy when there is one, and `fetchClip(from:)` downloads through
/// `URLSession` (a plain progressive MP4) before handing the local file to the player.
///
/// For the player, only progressive clips are cached. Apple serves HLS playlists, which are a
/// directory of segments rather than one file — `fetchClip` hands those straight to `AVPlayer`
/// and lets its own segment handling do the work. `fetchLocalClip` is the exception: the lock
/// screen takes only a file, so it joins the HLS clip into one.
