/// on a lot of what Apple misses, the community index is the only one that reaches back
/// catalogue, and Spotify has the original Canvas but needs the listener's own session cookie
/// to reach (see `CanvasSpotifyTokenStore`) and is a free no-op without one. Spotify goes
/// last by default even once it's set up: it's the heaviest of the four to reach (a web-view
/// harvest, not just a request) and the other three between them already cover most of what
/// it would have answered. Pass `spotifyFirst: true` (the Spotify integration setting) to put
/// it first when its original Canvas matters more than that lookup cost.
