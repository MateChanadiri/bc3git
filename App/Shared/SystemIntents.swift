// Ports widget/MediaWidgetActions.kt: the widget's transport buttons as App Intents.

// Android reaches playback from a widget tap by binding the media session, so the command runs in
// the app's process. `AudioPlaybackIntent` is the iOS counterpart: an interactive widget's
// audio-playback intent is performed in the app's process (launched in the background when it isn't
// running), where the player lives. These files are compiled into the app and the widget (and the
// Share Extension, which never runs them); only the app contains the handler, so the widget-side
// copy of `perform()` finds none and does nothing.
