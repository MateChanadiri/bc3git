// When the backdrop reads a frame off a playing Canvas clip (CanvasArtworkPlayer.kt's two
// `LaunchedEffect(rendered…)` blocks and NowPlayingScreen.kt's MESH_REFRESH_MS). Kept apart from
// the AVFoundation plumbing so the timing can be tested without a decoder.

/// Decides when the next frame read happens.
///
/// - Nothing is read until the clip's first frame is on screen: a read before then is the empty
///   buffer that turned the backdrop black.
/// - The first read happens the moment the clip is displayed, not a refresh interval later, so the
///   backdrop picks the clip's colours up together with the fade-in.
/// - A first read that comes back black or empty (the decoder's buffer lagging the layer by a
///   frame or two) is retried shortly rather than left for the whole interval.
/// - After that, one read every ``ArtworkMeshBackdropStyle/canvasRefreshInterval`` while the clip
///   plays; none while it's paused — the frame on screen isn't changing.
