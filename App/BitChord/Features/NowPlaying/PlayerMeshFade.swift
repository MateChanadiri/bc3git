// The mesh backdrop's crossfade (ArtworkMeshBackdrop.kt's `LaunchedEffect(mesh)`): each new mesh is
// drawn over the one on screen and eased in over MESH_FADE_MS with FastOutSlowIn. Theming's
// ``ArtworkMeshCrossfade`` is the same state machine, but a change arriving mid-fade there promotes
// the half-faded mesh to fully opaque, which is a visible jump every time a clip's read lands
// inside a track skip's fade. Here the half-faded layer is frozen where it stands instead, so the
// next fade really starts from what is on screen.

/// The layers the player's mesh backdrop draws, bottom to top, and how they fade.
///
/// - The first mesh has nothing to fade from: it is shown at once.
/// - Nil (a cover not read yet, the gap between two tracks) changes nothing — the last mesh stays
///   up. Nothing here ever takes the backdrop back to its bare floor colour.
/// - Reduced motion: every change is a cut.
/// - A change mid-fade freezes the fading layer at its current opacity and fades the new one in
///   over the lot, so the start of the new fade is exactly the picture that was on screen.
