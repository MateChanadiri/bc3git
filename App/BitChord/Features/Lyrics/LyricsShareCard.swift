// Ports ui/player/LyricsShareCard.kt: the picked lines as one picture, drawn to a bitmap you can
// send.
//
// ## Why this is drawn rather than screenshotted
//
// The same reason the Replay is. A screenshot of the lyrics panel carries the scrubber, the glow
// falloff, whichever lines happened to be on screen and the status bar of that particular phone, so
// two people sharing the same verse would send two different-looking pictures. A card laid out here
// is the verse, the sleeve and this app's mark, and nothing else — and it is only as tall as that
// verse needs, which holds it inside 1080×1920 (9:16): the shape a story or a chat head expects.
// Keeping it there is the panel's job, by refusing more words at the pick rather than by shrinking
// them here.
//
// ## Fitting the type
//
// A passage can be one line or twenty, so both the size and the height are chosen rather than
// fixed: the layout is retried down a fixed ladder of sizes until the rows stop overflowing, and the
// card is then grown to exactly the room those rows take. The bottom rung of that ladder is a floor
// rather than a last resort — no card ever sets type smaller than it to squeeze a passage in, so a
// passage too long for the frame lengthens the card instead of being cut, or made small enough to
// hold a phone at arm's length to read.
