// picture, page and genres.
//
// Most tracks reach the player with no album (a home card, a search hit, an AutoPlay suggestion),
// so the album chart would be empty for nearly everyone, and artist rows would have no page to
// open. The lookups run from the recorder's own ticks, so listening with the phone in a pocket
// is credited too, and never hold a sample back.
