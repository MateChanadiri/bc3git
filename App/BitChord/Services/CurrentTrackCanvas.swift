/// where the motion shows, whether or not Now Playing is open.

/// iOS-only on purpose: Android's engine publishes no animated artwork, so there is no port to
/// mirror. iOS 26+ takes it (`NowPlayingInfoBuilder` gates the publish); below that the still
/// cover stays as it always was and nothing here is even asked for.
///
/// What makes it onto the lock screen is decided by the pure key choice in
/// `NowPlayingInfoBuilder.animatedArtworkKey` — this side's job is only to fetch under
/// ``CanvasPolicy``, read the clip's true pixel size, and publish nothing when any part fails:
/// a miss, a metered network under Wi-Fi-only, a 9:16 clip, or a fetch that ends a stream
/// instead of a file all leave the still artwork exactly as it was.
/// Why the lock screen has (or lacks) an animated cover, for the nerd-stats overlay.
/// Diagnostic only: one test on a device shows which link in the chain broke.
