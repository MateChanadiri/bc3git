// Ports the Automix half of playback/AudioCache.kt (`renditionsOf`, `cacheKeyOf`,
// `requestAnalysisHead`, `discardBadRendition`): the analyzer and the version aligner read the
// playback cache's copies of a recording straight off disk.

/// The playback cache as Automix's ``AutomixRenditionProvider``.
///
/// AudioCache keeps each rendition as a sparse `<hash>.audio` file that only its resource loader
/// serves, and AVAssetReader picks a parser from the file extension, so each rendition on disk is
/// exposed as a hard link named with an audio extension (`<hash>.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.flac`…) in a
/// directory of its own. A hard link costs no space and always shows the cache's latest bytes (it
/// is the same inode), and it lives outside the cache directory so clearing the cache never has to
/// know about it.
///
/// The protocol is synchronous (the analyzer asks four times a second), the cache is an actor: the
/// answer is a snapshot per track, refreshed in the background whenever it is asked for and more
/// than ``refreshInterval`` old, so a rendition that grows is seen within a tick or two.
///
/// Eviction: a link whose cache file is gone has a link count of 1 (only the link names the
/// inode), and one whose entry was re-created points at a different inode than the cache's file.
/// Both are deleted on the next refresh and by ``sweep()``, which also runs once at start, so an
/// evicted track never keeps its bytes alive through the link.
